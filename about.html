      <p>I'm a part-time computer engineering student / stay-at-home-dad / Doordash driver. I took a leave
        of abscence from Colorado State University when my daughter started her freshman year there. That 
        makes me an empty-nester and my stay-at-home-dad status has changed to homemaker. I was already 
        cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, yardwork, finances, and home maintenance; now I do it for my
        hard-working wife and live-in mother-in-law with dementia. When I can, I continue to study and tinker.<br> <br> 
        I have an A.A.S. in electronics/robotics and a general associate of science degree from Front Range Community College.
        I've worked as an electronics assembler, machine operator, electronics technician, test-engineering technician,
        technical trainer, math tutor, and electrical engineering tutor. I like technical work, but my empathic nature has
        steered me towards tutoring and training as well.<br><br> In the past few years, I've switched over to studying the software side of things
        and steered my academic path towards studying computer, rather than electrical engineering. I was finding more
        and more that building real-life gizmos requires knowledge of code. After taking a few classes in 
        computer science (C, C++, Java, Discrete Math, Algorithms), it seemed that the young engineering 
        students at university had picked up some basic web development and used it as a basic skill. This didn't seem like a big deal 
        until I took an operating systems class and it was assumed to be pre-requisite knowledge. 
        Being a bit older, I needed to dedicate some time to learn it. So for now, I am studying web development. 
        Making robots work is the thrill I would like to get back to.</p>
