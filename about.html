      <p>I'm a computer engineering student at Colorado State University. I have an A.A.S. in electronics 
        and a general associate of science degree from Front Range Community College. I've worked as an 
        electronics technician, test-engineering technician, technical trainer, math and electrical
        engineering tutor. Recently, I've switched over to the software side of things and steered my
        path towards computer, rather than electrical engineering. I was finding more and more that 
        building real life gizmos requires knowledge of code. After studying some basic code (C, C++, Java,
        python), it seemed more and more that a big part of computing is to connect to the rest of the world.
        Now I am studying web development. Making robots work through internet control would be living 
        the dream.</p>
